[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/andrasq/node-qmock.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/andrasq/node-qmock)
[![Coverage Status](https://codecov.io/github/andrasq/node-qmock/coverage.svg?branch=master)](https://codecov.io/github/andrasq/node-qmock?branch=master)

Light-weight test double library for easier testing of dependency injection style
code.  Patterned somewhat after `phpunit`, which looks like `junit` I believe.

Can [stub, spy](#stub-and-spy-api), and [mock classes, objects](#mock-objects-api), the
[system timers](#mock-timers-api), [`require()`](#mock-require-api) and [http calls](#mock-http-api).

`qmock` is testing framework agnostic; mocks can be used standalone.  They are
integrated into the [`qnit`](https://npmjs.com/package/qnit) unit test runner.


Example
-------

    qmock = require('qmock');

    // mock an existing object
    var mock = qmock.getMock(console);

    // instrument log() and ensure that it is called with 'hello'
    // full phpunit syntax should also work, ie
    // mock.expects(qmock.twice()).method('log').with('hello');
    mock.expects(2).method('log').with('hello');
    mock.log('hello');
    qmock.check(mock);      // assertion error, called 1 times, expected 2

    // with() is sticky, all subsequent calls must also match
    mock.log('world');
    qmock.check(mock);     // assertion error, 'world' !== 'hello'

    // methods don't have to already exist.  create and call a stub method
    // by specifying what it will return:
    mock.expects(1).method('boom').will(qmock.throwError(new Error("BOOM!")));
    mock.boom();            // error throw, BOOM!


Mock Objects API
----------------

`qmock.getMock(master)` returns a mock object that is instanceof `master`.
The master can be a class (constructor function) or an existing object.
The mock is a fully functional object, with some methods possibly stubbed out.

### qmock.getMock( master, methodNames [,constructorArgs] )

If master is a class (a constructor function), returns a mock object built with the
given constructorArgs.

If master is an object, an identical object is cloned.  The clone will be
instanceof the same class as `master`, and will have the same own and inherited
properties as `master`.

In both cases, some or all of the named methods are replaced by no-op stubs.  If
`methodNames` is given as falsy, no methods are stubbed; if an Array, the named
methods are stubbed; if not passed, all methods are stubbed.

Example:

    var fakeLogger = qmock.getMock({}, ['log']);
    fakeLogger.log("test message");

### qmock.getMockSkipConstructor( master, methodNames )

Build a mock object like `getMock` but do not initialize the object.  The returned
object will still have the instance, own and inherited properties of `master`, but
will be completely un-initialized.

If master is an existing object, this call is identical to `getMock`.


## Mock Objects


Stub and Spy API
----------------

Stubs are stand-in methods that track and instrument calls.  Spies are fully
functional methods annotated with instrumentation.  Their functionality overlaps.

## qmock.stub( )

With no arguments, returns an instrumented anonymous function like `qmock.spy()`.

## qmock.stub( func )

Return an instrumented anonymous function that will invoke `func`.  `restore()` returns
the original `func`.

## qmock.stub( object, methodName [,overrideFunction] )

Replace the named method of `object` with an anonymous noop function or the specified
override, and return a stub object that will contain information about calls to the
method.  This form can be used to suppress or rewrite method calls.

If an override function is not specified, a noop function is used (changed in 0.4.0).
The noop function does not call its callback, if any.

Use `spy` to passively examine calls to an existing method or function.

Returns a `stub` object that is updated with information about the last call's
arguments, return value, exception thrown, and callback arguments:

### stub.callCount

Number of calls made to the stub.

### stub.callArguments

Array with the arguments from the last call to the stub.

### stub.callResult

Last value returned from the stub function, `undefined` if it threw an `Error`.

### stub.callError

The error generated by the last call to the stub function, `null` if none.  A
successful call following a call that threw replaces the error with `null`.

### stub.error

Like `stub.callError`, but `error` is sticky, and contains the last error thrown by
any call to the stub.

### stub.callCallbackArguments

If the last argument passed to a stub is a function, it will be assumed to be the
callback.  A copy of the arguments passed to the callback will be be in
`callCallbackArguments`.  Note:  callbacks are not synchronized with calls to the
stub, so the callback arguments may not be from the most recent call.

### stub.restore( )

Remove the stub and restore the original method back onto the object.
Bare functions cannot be restored, only object methods can.
Returns the original spied-on or stubbed method.

Example:

    var qmock = require('qmock');
    var assert = require('assert');

    var stub = qmock.stub(process, 'exit', function(){});
    process.exit(1);
    process.exit(2, 3);
    console.log("did not exit");
    // => did not exit

    assert.equal(stub.callCount, 2);
    assert.deepEqual(stub.callArguments, [2, 3]);

    stub.restore();
    process.exit();
    // process exited, program stopped

    console.log("this line will not appear");
    // no output, line not reached

## qmock.spy( [func] )

Spy on calls to the given function.  Returns an instrumented function that tracks
calls to `func`.  If no func is given, an anonymous function is created to be spied
on, which can then be passed as eg a callback.  Returns the spy function.  The stats
are accessible in the property `spy.stub`.

Example

    var qmock = require('qmock');
    var computeFunc = function(a, b) { return a + b };
    var spyFunc = qmock.spy(computeFunc);

    var c = spyFunc(1, 2);
    computeFunc = spyFunc.restore();

    // c => 3
    // spyFunc.stub.callCount => 1
    // spyFunc.stub.callArguments => [1, 2]

## qmock.spy( object, methodName [,override] )

Spy on calls to the named method of the object.  If the `override` function is given,
the method will be replaced with the override.  Returns a `spy` object that holds
information about the calls made.  The object method can be restored to the original
with `spy.restore()`.

The returned `spy` contains the call stats like `qmock.stub()`, with additional
methods:

Example

    var qmock = require('qmock');
    var originalWrite = process.stderr.write;
    process.stderr.write = qmock.spy(function(str, cb) {
        console.log("would have written %d bytes", str.length);
        if (cb) cb();
    });
    process.stderr.write("test message\n");
    // => would have written 13 bytes

    process.stderr.write = originalWrite;
    process.stderr.write("another message\n");
    // => another message

### spy.getAllArguments( )

Return the argument vectors passed to the first 10 calls of the spied function.
For convenience, this information is also available in the `spy.args` array.

### spy.getAllResults( )

Return the values returned by the first 10 calls to the spied function.

### spy.getAllErrors( )

Return the errors thrown by the first 10 calls to the spied function.  If no error
was thrown by a call, the array contains a `null` entry for it.

### spy.getAllCallbackArguments( )

Return the argument vectors passed to the stub callback.  The callback is recognized
as a function passed as the last value in the stub arguments list.  Note that
callbacks may be called out of order, so the returned argument may not match 1-to-1
the stub arguments passed in `getAllArguments`.

Example

    var qmock = require('./');
    var spy = qmock.spy(process.stderr, 'write', function(str, cb) {
        console.log("would have written %d bytes", str.length);
        if (cb) cb();
    });
    process.stderr.write("test message\n");
    // => would have written 13 bytes

    spy.restore();
    process.stderr.write("another message\n");
    // => another message

## qmock.stubOnce( object, methodName [,overrideFunction] )

One-shot stub:  stub the method like `qmock.stub()`, but `restore` the original
method after the first call.

## qmock.spyOnce( object, methodName [,override] )

One-shot spy:  spy on the function or method like `qmock.spy()`, but `restore` the
original after the first call.


Mock Timers API
---------------

`mockTimers` overrides the system setImmediate, setTimeout, etc calls with mock
work-alikes that trigger under user control.  `unmockTimers` restores the system
timers.

## qmock.mockTimers( )

Replace the nodejs timers functions `setImmediate`, `clearImmediate`, `setTimeout`
et al with mocked versions whose time is not linear and is not limited by real
time.  Returns a clock object.  To restore the timers back to their original
unmodified versions, use `qmock.unmockTimers()`.

This function can be called any number of times, each call replaces the previous
timers calls in effect with a new set.  Note that any pending immediates and timeouts
in the system timers will still trigger, but with follow-up timeouts queued into the
mock.

Returns a mock timeouts `clock` that controls the passage of events time:

### clock.tick( [n] )

Advances mock timers time by `n` milliseconds (default 1).  Immediates and timeouts
are run as they come due, immediates before timeouts.  0 milliseconds runs only the
immediates.

### clock.immediates

The array of immediate tasks that will execute on the next event loop `tick`.

### clock.timeouts

A hash indexed by the expiration timestamp of arrays of timeouts.

### clock.timestamp

The current mock timers timestamp that is advanced by `tick`.

Example:

    var qmock = require('qmock');
    var clock = qmock.mockTimers();
    setTimeout(function() {
        console.log("timeout");
        setImmediate(function() {
            console.log("immediate");
            qmock.unmockTimers();
        });
    }, 10);
    clock.tick(9);
    // => (nothing)
    clock.tick(1);
    // => "timeout"
    clock.tick(0);
    // => "immediate"

## qmock.unmockTimers( )

Restore the global `setImmediate`, `setTimeout` etc functions back to their inital
original nodejs versions.  Can be called any time.  Note that any pending timeouts
in the mock timers can still be triggered with `clock.tick()`.


Mock Require API
----------------

`mockRequire` overrides `require` everywhere to return the mock value
for the named modules.

## qmock.mockRequire( moduleName, replacement )

Arrange for `require` of `moduleName` to return `replacement` in all sources,
even if `moduleName` had been loaded previously.  Calls to `mockRequire` are
cumulative, each one defines one more module that will be mocked.

It is an error for `moduleName` to be falsy.

## qmock.mockRequireStub( moduleName, handler )

Stub `require` of `moduleName` with the provided handler function, and return the
value it computes.  Handler is invoked as `handler(moduleName)`.

## qmock.unmockRequire( [moduleName] )

If `moduleName` is provided, arrange for `require` of `moduleName` to load
the actual module and not the mock replacement value.

Without a module name, uninstall the mock require hooks and restore the
original unmodified system `require` functionality.  All previously defined
module mocks are cleared.

## qmock.unrequire( moduleName )

Helper function to restore the system to the state it was in before
the named module was ever `require`-d.  It deletes all cached copies of the
module from `require.cache`, `module.children`, `module.parent.children` etc.


Mock Http API
-------------

`mockHttp` overrides `http.request` and `https.request` with mocks that return
user supplied values.  `unmockHttp` restores the system http functions.

## qmock.mockHttp( handler(req, res) )

Override `http.request` and `https.request` to redirect all web requests to the
provided handler.  Each new request will make a call to `handler`.  Request and
response behavior and emulation is up to the handler.  The handler is invoked
immediately after the caller receives the `req` return object.  This function can
be called at any time, each replaces the previous override.  Restore the default
system request functionality with `unmockHttp`.

The `request` callback is passed the mock `res` object or the `res` supplied by the
handler as asson as `mockResponse` event is emitted `req.emit('mockResponse', [res])`.

Note that the handler gets a client-side `http.ClientRequest` (what the client sends
to the server) and `http.IncomingMessage` (what the client receives back), not the
usual server-side `IncomingMessage` and `ServerResponse` objects.

Example

    qmock.mockHttp(function(req, res) {
        req.emit('mockResponse');
        res.emit('data', "mock data");
        res.emit('end');
    })
    var req = http.request("http://localhost", function(res) {
        res.on('data', function(chunk) {
            console.log("got:", chunk);
        })
        res.on('end', function() {
            qmock.unmockHttp();
        })
    })
    // => got: mock data

## qmock.mockHttp( )

Experimental.

Without arguments, `mockHttp` mocks an http server, and returns the mock server
object.  The mock server has methods to recognize and respond to calls to mocked
routes.

### server.when( condition )

Match the route against the condition.  If the route matches `condition`, the actions
that follow will be run to generate the response for the route.  Only the first matching
condition will have its actions run.

The `http.request` callback is called before the first matching action is run, and the
`'end'` event is emitted when no more actions are left to run.  Note that because the
actions that build the respones have not been run yet, the `res.statusCode` and other
response fields may remain undefined until the res `'end'` event has been received.

Conditions:

- `string` - match the full url or the request pathname against the string
- `METHOD:string` - match the full annotated url or annotated request pathname against the string,
  The annotated url would look something like "POST:http://localhost:80/pathname".
- `RegExp` - match the url or pathname against the regular expression
- `function(req, res)` - use the given function to test whether the route matches

Examples:

    .when('http://localhost:80/')       - match any http request to localhost port 80
    .when(/\/test\//)                   - match any request with "/test/" in its pathname
    .when(/^POST:/)                     - match any POST request
    .when(/^/)                          - match any request
    .when(function(req, res) {          - match any request with Basic user:pass authorization
        return (req._headers['authorization'].indexOf('Basic ') === 0);
    })

### server.on( condition )

An alias for `server.when`.

### server.once( condition )

Like `server.when`, but the condition will be matched only once.  After the first match,
it will not match any other request.  This allows the mock to return different responses
to the same request.  The matching actions are run in the order defined.

    qmock.mockHttp()
        .once('http://host/getNext')
          .send(200, 'data1')
        .once('http://host/getNext')
          .send(200, 'data2')
        .once('http://host/getNext')
          .send(500, 'could not get more');

    // http.request('http://host/getNext') => 'data1', statusCode 200
    // http.request('http://host/getNext') => 'data2', statusCode 200
    // http.request('http://host/getNext') => 'could not get more', statusCode 500

### server.default( )

An alias for a condition that always matches the route, equivalent to `.when(/.*/)`.
Define a `default` as the very last condition, because conditions are tested in the
order defined and the default always matches all routes so no other conditions will
be tested.

### server.before( )

The `before` actions are run for all matched routes before their condition actions are run.

### server.after( )

The `after` actions are run for all matched routes after their condition actions are run.

Actions:

### server.send( [statusCode], [responseBody], [responseHeaders] )

Set the response `statusCode` and `responseHeaders`, write the `responseBody`, and
finish the response.  No more data should be written after the response has been
finished.

### server.send( responseFunction(req, res, next) )

Call the provided `responseFunction` to generate the response.

### server.write( responseBodyChunk )

Cause `res` to emit a `'data'` event with the given chunk.

### server.writeHead( [statusCode], [responseHeaders] )

Set the response statusCode and headers.

### server.end( [statusCode], [responseBody] )

### server.compute( callback(req, res, next) )

Invoke the provided callout, let it adjust `res`.

### server.delay( ms )

Pause for `ms` milliseconds before continuing with the rest of the condition actions.

### server.emit( event, [arg1, arg2, ...] )

Emit an event on the `res` object.

### server.throw( err )

Emit the error event on the `req` object.

Example

    var mockServer = qmock.mockHttp()
        .when("http://localhost:1337/test/call")
          .send(204)
        .when("http://localhost:1337/test/error")
          .emit('error', new Error("error 409"))
          .send(409, "test error 409", { 'test-header-1': 'test-value-1' })

    var req = http.request("http://localhost:1337/test/error", function(res) {
        var response = "";
        res.on('data', function(chunk) {
            response += chunk;
        })
        res.on('end', function() {
            assert.equal(res.statusCode, 409);
            assert.equal(response, "test error 409");
            assert.equal(res.headers['test-header-1'], 'test-value-1');
        })
        res.on('error', function(err) {
            console.log("got err '%s'", err.message)
        })
    })
    req.end("test request body");

    // => got err 'error 409'

## qmock.unmockHttp( )

Restore the original system implementations for `http.request` and `https.request`.
This function can be called any time.

Todo
----

- the nodejs property getter/setter methods should make it possible for data
  properties to be mocked too, eg getMockValue(name).  with() could map to
  set, will() to get.
- introduce a havingReturned() method to be able to inspect not just the
  called with arguments but the method return value as well
- add returnCallback() method to return err, for callbacks not just direct returns
- clone un-enumerable properties as well, retaining their original definitions
- `inherit()` and `disinherit()` calls: annotate the prototype (inherited properties) of the object,
  for e.g. `x = 3; inherit(x, 'a', 1); assert(x.a === 1)`
- .when().timeout(ms) action to emulate a req timeout
- todo: publish req._mockWrites, useful for debugging
- todo: error out on write after end, to catch errors
- todo: stub().throws(string or Error) - always throw
- todo: stub().returns(value) - always return value
- todo: stub().callsBack(err, value) - always return value to callback
- could use a `makeRequest()` mockHttp action to return an actual http request
