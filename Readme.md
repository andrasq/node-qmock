[![Coverage Status](https://codecov.io/github/andrasq/node-qmock/coverage.svg?branch=master)](https://codecov.io/github/andrasq/node-qmock?branch=master)

Light-weight test double library for easier testing of dependency injection style
code.  Patterned somewhat after `phpunit`, which looks like `junit` I believe.

Can stub, spy, and mock classes, objects, the system timers, and http calls.

`qmock` is testing framework agnostic; mocks can be used standalone.  They are
integrated into the [`qnit`](https://npmjs.com/package/qnit) unit test runner.


Example
-------

    qmock = require('qmock');

    // mock an existing object
    var mock = qmock.getMock(console);

    // instrument log() and ensure that it is called with 'hello'
    // full phpunit syntax should also work, ie
    // mock.expects(qmock.twice()).method('log').with('hello');
    mock.expects(2).method('log').with('hello');
    mock.log('hello');
    qmock.check(mock);      // assertion error, called 1 times, expected 2

    // with() is sticky, all subsequent calls must also match
    mock.log('world');
    qmock.check(mock);     // assertion error, 'world' !== 'hello'

    // methods don't have to already exist.  create and call a stub method
    // by specifying what it will return:
    mock.expects(1).method('boom').will(qmock.throwError(new Error("BOOM!")));
    mock.boom();            // error throw, BOOM!


Mock Objects API
----------------

`qmock.getMock(master)` returns a mock object that is instanceof `master`.
The master can be a class (constructor function) or an existing object.
The mock is a fully functional object, with some methods possibly stubbed out.

### qmock.getMock( master, methodNames [,constructorArgs] )

If master is a class (a constructor function), returns a mock object built with the
given constructorArgs.

If master is an object, an identical object is cloned.  The clone will be
instanceof the same class as `master`, and will have the same own and inherited
properties as `master`.

In both cases, some or all of the named methods are replaced by no-op stubs.  If
`methodNames` is given as falsy, no methods are stubbed; if an Array, the named
methods are stubbed; if not passed, all methods are stubbed.

Example:

    var fakeLogger = qmock.getMock({}, ['log']);
    fakeLogger.log("test message");

### qmock.getMockSkipConstructor( master, methodNames )

Build a mock object like `getMock` but do not initialize the object.  The returned
object will still have the instance, own and inherited properties of `master`, but
will be completely un-initialized.

If master is an existing object, this call is identical to `getMock`.


## Mock Objects


Stub and Spy API
----------------

Stubs are stand-in methods that track and instrument calls.  Spies are fully
functional methods annotated with instrumentation.  Their functionality overlaps.

## qmock.stub( )

With no arguments, returns an instrumented anonymous stub function like `qmock.spy()`.

## qmock.stub( object, methodName [,overrideFunction] )

Replace the named method of `object` with an anonymous noop function or the specified
override, and return a stub object that will contain information about calls to the
method.  This form can be used to suppress or rewrite method calls.

If an override function is not specified, a noop function is used (changed in 0.4.0).
The noop function does not call its callback, if any.

Use `spy` to passively examine calls to an existing method or function.

Returns a `stub` object that is updated with information about the last call's
arguments, return value, exception thrown, and callback arguments:

### stub.callCount

Number of calls made to the stub.

### stub.callArguments

Array with the arguments from the last call to the stub.

### stub.callResult

Last value returned from the stub function, `undefined` if it threw an `Error`.

### stub.callError

The error generated by the last call to the stub function, `null` if none.  A
successful call following a call that threw replaces the error with `null`.

### stub.error

Like `stub.callError`, but `error` is sticky, and contains the last error thrown by
any call to the stub.

### stub.callCallbackArguments

If the last argument passed to a stub is a function, it will be assumed to be the
callback.  A copy of the arguments passed to the callback will be be in
`callCallbackArguments`.  Note:  callbacks are not synchronized with calls to the
stub, so the callback arguments may not be from the most recent call.

### stub.restore( )

Remove the stub and restore the original method back onto the object.
Bare functions cannot be restored, only object methods can.

Example:

    var qmock = require('qmock');
    var assert = require('assert');

    var stub = qmock.stub(process, 'exit', function(){});
    process.exit(1);
    process.exit(2, 3);
    console.log("did not exit");
    // => did not exit

    assert.equal(stub.callCount, 2);
    assert.deepEqual(stub.callArguments, [2, 3]);

    stub.restore();
    process.exit();
    // process exited, program stopped

    console.log("this line will not appear");
    // no output, line not reached

## qmock.spy( [func] )

Spy on calls to the given function.  Returns an instrumented function that tracks
calls to `func`.  If no func is given, an anonymous function is created to be spied
on, which can then be passed as eg a callback.  Returns the spy function.  The stats
are accessible in the property `spy.stub`.

Example

    var qmock = require('qmock');
    var computeFunc = function(a, b) { return a + b };
    var spyFunc = qmock.spy(computeFunc);

    var c = spyFunc(1, 2);

    // c => 3
    // spyFunc.stub.callCount => 1
    // spyFunc.stub.callArguments => [1, 2]

## qmock.spy( object, methodName [,override] )

Spy on calls to the named method of the object.  If the `override` function is given,
the method will be replaced with the override.  Returns a `spy` object that holds
information about the calls made.  The object method can be restored to the original
with `spy.restore()`.

The returned `spy` contains the call stats like `qmock.stub()`, with additional
methods:

Example

    var qmock = require('qmock');
    var originalWrite = process.stderr.write;
    process.stderr.write = qmock.spy(function(str, cb) {
        console.log("would have written %d bytes", str.length);
        if (cb) cb();
    });
    process.stderr.write("test message\n");
    // => would have written 13 bytes

    process.stderr.write = originalWrite;
    process.stderr.write("another message\n");
    // => another message

### spy.getAllArguments( )

Return the argument vectors passed to the first 10 calls of the spied function.
For convenience, this information is also available in the `spy.args` array.

### spy.getAllResults( )

Return the values returned by the first 10 calls to the spied function.

### spy.getAllErrors( )

Return the errors thrown by the first 10 calls to the spied function.  If no error
was thrown by a call, the array contains a `null` entry for it.

### spy.getAllCallbackArguments( )

Return the argument vectors passed to the stub callback.  The callback is recognized
as a function passed as the last value in the stub arguments list.  Note that
callbacks may be called out of order, so the returned argument may not match 1-to-1
the stub arguments passed in `getAllArguments`.

Example

    var qmock = require('./');
    var spy = qmock.spy(process.stderr, 'write', function(str, cb) {
        console.log("would have written %d bytes", str.length);
        if (cb) cb();
    });
    process.stderr.write("test message\n");
    // => would have written 13 bytes

    spy.restore();
    process.stderr.write("another message\n");
    // => another message

## qmock.stubOnce( object, methodName [,overrideFunction] )

One-shot stub:  stub the method like `qmock.stub()`, but `restore` the original
method after the first call.

## qmock.spyOnce( object, methodName [,override] )

One-shot spy:  spy on the function or method like `qmock.spy()`, but `restore` the
original after the first call.


Mock Timers API
---------------

`mockTimers` overrides the system setImmediate, setTimeout, etc calls with mock
work-alikes that trigger under user control.  `unmockTimers` restores the system
timers.

## qmock.mockTimers( )

Replace the nodejs timers functions `setImmediate`, `clearImmediate`, `setTimeout`
et al with mocked versions whose time is not linear and is not limited by real
time.  Returns a clock object.  To restore the timers back to their original
unmodified versions, use `qmock.unmockTimers()`.

This function can be called any number of times, each call replaces the previous
timers calls in effect with a new set.  Note that any pending immediates and timeouts
in the system timers will still trigger, but with follow-up timeouts queued into the
mock.

Returns a mock timeouts `clock` that controls the passage of events time:

### clock.tick( [n] )

Advances mock timers time by `n` milliseconds (default 1).  Immediates and timeouts
are run as they come due, immediates before timeouts.  0 milliseconds runs only the
immediates.

### clock.immediates

The array of immediate tasks that will execute on the next event loop `tick`.

### clock.timeouts

A hash indexed by the expiration timestamp of arrays of timeouts.

### clock.timestamp

The current mock timers timestamp that is advanced by `tick`.

Example:

    var qmock = require('qmock');
    var clock = qmock.mockTimers();
    setTimeout(function() {
        console.log("timeout");
        setImmediate(function() {
            console.log("immediate");
            qmock.unmockTimers();
        });
    }, 10);
    clock.tick(9);
    // => (nothing)
    clock.tick(1);
    // => "timeout"
    clock.tick(0);
    // => "immediate"

## qmock.unmockTimers( )

Restore the global `setImmediate`, `setTimeout` etc functions back to their inital
original nodejs versions.  Can be called any time.  Note that any pending timeouts
in the mock timers can still be triggered with `clock.tick()`.


Mock Http API
-------------

`mockHttp` overrides `http.request` and `https.request` with mocks that return
user supplied values.  `unmockHttp` restores the system http functions.

## qmock.mockHttp( handler(req, res) )

Override `http.request` and `https.request` to redirect all web requests to the
provided handler.  Each new request will make a call to `handler`.  Request and
response behavior and emulation is up to the handler.  The handler is invoked
immediately after the caller receives the `req` return object.  This function can
be called at any time, each replaces the previous override.  Restore the default
system request functionality with `unmockHttp`.

The `request` callback is passed the mock `res` object or the `res` supplied by the
handler as asson as `mockResponse` event is emitted `req.emit('mockResponse', [res])`.

Note that the handler gets a client-side `http.ClientRequest` (what the client sends
to the server) and `http.IncomingMessage` (what the client receives back), not the
usual server-side `IncomingMessage` and `ServerResponse` objects.

Example

    qmock.mockHttp(function(req, res) {
        req.emit('mockResponse');
        res.emit('data', "mock data");
        res.emit('end');
    })
    var req = http.request("http://localhost", function(res) {
        res.on('data', function(chunk) {
            console.log("got:", chunk);
        })
        res.on('end', function() {
            qmock.unmockHttp();
        })
    })
    // => got: mock data

## qmock.mockHttp( )

Experimental.

Without arguments, `mockHttp` mocks an http server, and returns the mock server
object.  The mock server has methods to recognize and respond to calls to mocked
routes.

### server.when( condition )

Match the route against the condition.  If the route matches `condition`, the actions
that follow will be run to generate the response for the route.

The `http.request` callback is called before the first matching action is run, and the
`'end'` event is emitted when no more actions are left to run.  Note that because the
actions that build the respones have not been run yet, the `res.statusCode` and other
response fields may remain undefined until the res `'end'` event has been received.

Conditions:

- `string` - match the full url or the request pathname against the string
- `METHOD:string` - match the full annotated url or annotated request pathname against the string,
  The annotated url would look something like "POST:http://localhost:80/pathname".
- `RegExp` - match the url or pathname against the regular expression
- `function(req, res)` - use the given function to test whether the route matches

Examples:

    .when('http://localhost:80/')       - match any http request to localhost port 80
    .when(/\/test\//)                   - match any request with "/test/" in its pathname
    .when(/^POST:/)                     - match any POST request
    .when(/^/)                          - match any request
    .when(function(req, res) {          - match any request with Basic user:pass authorization
        return (req._headers['authorization'].indexOf('Basic ') === 0);
    })

### server.before( )

The `before` actions are run for all matched routes before their condition actions are run.

### server.after( )

The `after` actions are run for all matched routes after their condition actions are run.

Actions:

### server.send( [statusCode], [responseBody], [responseHeaders] )

### server.write( responseBodyChunk )

### server.writeHead( [statusCode], [responseHeaders] )

### server.end( [statusCode], [responseBody] )

### server.compute( callback(req, res, next) )

### server.delay( ms )

### server.emit( event, [arg1, arg2, ...] )

Emit an event on the `res` object.

### server.throw( err )

Emit the error event on the `req` object.

Example

    var mockServer = qmock.mockHttp()
        .when("http://localhost:1337/test/call")
          .send(204)
        .when("http://localhost:1337/test/error")
          .emit('error', new Error("error 409"))
          .send(409, "test error 409", { 'test-header-1': 'test-value-1' })

    var req = http.request("http://localhost:1337/test/error", function(res) {
        var response = "";
        res.on('data', function(chunk) {
            response += chunk;
        })
        res.on('end', function() {
            assert.equal(res.statusCode, 409);
            assert.equal(response, "test error 409");
            assert.equal(res.headers['test-header-1'], 'test-value-1');
        })
        res.on('error', function(err) {
            console.log("got err '%s'", err.message)
        })
    })
    req.end("test request body");

    // => got err 'error 409'

## qmock.unmockHttp( )

Restore the original system implementations for `http.request` and `https.request`.
This function can be called any time.

Todo
----

- the nodejs property getter/setter methods should make it possible for data
  properties to be mocked too, eg getMockValue(name).  with() could map to
  set, will() to get.
- introduce a havingReturned() method to be able to inspect not just the
  called with arguments but the method return value as well
- add returnCallback() method to return err, for callbacks not just direct returns
- clone un-enumerable properties as well, retaining their original definitions
- `inherit()` and `disinherit()` calls: annotate the prototype (inherited properties) of the object,
  for e.g. `x = 3; inherit(x, 'a', 1); assert(x.a === 1)`
- mockHttp() needs a `when('default')` clause and a `makeRequest()` action
  ('default' is easier to read than a match-all regex eg `/^/`)
- make mockHttpServer server.when matches be use-once, deleted once consumed.
  Could then pre-configure multiple different for the same query, each used just once.
  Add a `.reuse()` setting to tag which handlers to reuse, which to delete.
- .when().timeout(ms) action to emulate a req timeout
